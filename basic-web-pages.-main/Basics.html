    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <h2>Heading</h2>
    <p2>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p2>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <P>This how you make an unordered list:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li"element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <li></li><p>Add a "ul"element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
  </ul>
    <p>I This is what an ordered lists looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should also be noticing things is this precise order, because this an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
