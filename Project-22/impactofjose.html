            <h1> The Contatious Smile 
                of 
                Jose Fernandez </h1>
            <p>The news sent shockwaves across the MLB with players and personnel remembering a generational talent and man with a quick smile.The Marlins scheduled game against the Atlanta Braves Sunday afternoon was canceled after the news broke. The team held a press conference Sunday where players and management shared their memories of the 24-year-old and expressed their grief over his passing. “His love of the game, his passion for the game, his respect of the game… his love of this organization and his teammates and his family above all… you just think about all of those things,” David Samson, the president of the Miami Marlins said. Marlins manager Don Mattingly choked back tears as he spoke about how he will remember Fernandez’s infectious attitude and his love of baseball.</p>

        <h1>  Passing of Rookie Sensation  </h1>
        <p>The 24-year-old pitching sensation's fingerprint and DNA were found on the steering wheel, and his DNA was also found on the throttle of the 32-foot vessel named "Kaught Looking," according to the final incident report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Fernández owned the vessel, which was traveling at about 66 mph when it struck a jetty near Miami Beach in the early morning hours of September 25, according to digital forensic analysis of its GPS units, the report said. The report offers a look into the last hours of one of baseball's premier young pitchers, including a screenshot of a text message from Fernández' girlfriend to one of the men on the boat. She wrote that Fernández was "not in the best state of mind," that they had argued recently and that he was "pushing me out the door."  "I just need you to take care of him," the girlfriend wrote to Rivero. 'It's not my time yet'. A friend of Rivero also posted a photo of text messages he exchanged with Rivero on the night of the accident, according to the report. In the messages, Rivero's friend urged him to "keep Joe cool" and "keep him close to shore." "Trust me," Rivero wrote back. "It's not my time yet."</p>

        <h1> The Presence He Left </h1>
        <p>Fernandez’s back story was a baseball fairy tale. As a teenager, he was jailed for trying to defect. He finally made it out on his fourth attempt, at age 15 in 2008, and saved his mother from drowning when she fell overboard into violent waters on their way to Mexico.“As mad as he would make you with some of the stuff he would do, you just see that little kid you see when you watch kids play Little League,” Mattingly said. “That’s the joy that Jose played with, and the passion he felt about playing. That’s what I think about.” Giancarlo Stanton, the Marlins’ star outfielder, wrote on Instagram that he had called Fernandez “Niño” because he seemed like a boy among men — “yet those men could rarely compete with him.” Brandon McCarthy, a Dodgers pitcher, wrote on Twitter that players were jealous of Fernandez’s talent, “but deep down I think we most envied the fun he had while doing something so difficult.”</p>
