                the Marlins </h1>
            <p>If only No. 16 would have still been able to take the mound, things would be really different for the Marlins today, and perhaps even around Major League Baseball.Imagine Marlins Park packed to capacity with fans watching them play a postseason game. And not in three or four years if owners Derek Jeter and Bruce Sherman’s plan works. It might have happened at the end of last season. Perhaps even this season. Maybe Giancarlo Stanton would have still been in his familiar spot in right field with Marcell Ozuna in the other corner and Christian Yelichbetween them in center. And perhaps Dee Gordon would have still been there at second base, and leading off for the Marlins.</p>

        <h1> Passing of a Star in 
            the Making </h1>
        <p>The tragic events of Sept. 25, 2016, when Fernandez and friends Emilio Jesus Macias and Eduardo Rivero were all killed in a boating accident off South Beach, forever changed the direction of the Marlins franchise and put a series of events in motion that are still having ripple effects in Miami and around the sport.Fernandez is still beloved by the fans and many who knew him around the game and admired not only his skill, but his charisma and passion for the game. Fernandez had one of the best seasons not only of any rookie in the National League, but also of any pitcher. The Cy Young Award candidate posted a 2.19 ERA and a 12-6 record during the season. A closer look at his stats will reveal why Fernandez was certainly worthy of this honor. He struck out 187 batters in 172.2 innings, posted a WHIP of just 0.98 and allowed opposing batters to hit a paltry .182 against him. </p>

        <h1> Selling the Team</h1>
        <p>Yelich said in an interview with Barstool Sports earlier this season things were never quite the same in the Marlins’ clubhouse after Fernandez died. Even after Fernandez died, then-owner Jeffrey Loria chose to try to win immediately and added more expensive contracts to a roster that already had long-term deals, such as Stanton’s 13-year, $325 million contract and Wei-Yin Chen’s five-year, $80 million deal. The additions of starter Edinson Volquez and relievers Junichi Tazawa and Brad Ziegler, and an extension to third baseman Martin Prado’s contract added to the team’s record-high payroll in excess of $116 million. Once in control, Jeter’s group moved forward with a rebuilding plan that began with a series of trades of Stanton, Yelich, Gordon and Ozuna for a number of prospects that also led to improved financial flexibility. The long-term results of those moves remains to be seen, but the Marlins have shown some potential for eventual success after bolstering a barren farm system that had been rated the worst in baseball for two years earlier. But the Marlins are still a long way from contending as this season has proven, with a handful of games remaining before they wrap up their ninth consecutive losing campaign and 15th in a row without a playoff berth.</p>
