            <h1> Chaotic Upbringing of Fernandez </h1>
            <p>A hyper-active child, before turning five he was already kicking up a storm in his dusty street in the working class barrio La Macuca. By 6 a.m. his mother says he would be outside playing baseball with sticks and stones.If you wanted to find a good bat near Fernandez’s childhood home in Santa Clara, Cuba, you were better off moving away from the trees and into the fields. Louisville Sluggers were predictably scarce on the island, so as a 5-year-old in search of a proper bat, he had to take inventory of the sticks near his family farm. Breaking a branch off a tree wouldn’t work. A fresh branch, Fernandez explains, would probably be damp. Damp branches break. Three times, they set off for Miami. Three times, they failed. Fernandez spent a few months in a Cuban prison, an attempted defector surrounded by murderers, a 14-year-old boy locked up with grown men. He doesn’t ever want to think about the food again — “I have no idea how I would even describe it in English,” he says, “but believe me, you don’t want to know.” He tries not to remember all those bodies cramped into so little space. And he doesn’t let his mind dwell on the inmate killings. “To them, their lives were already over,” Fernandez says. “What did it matter to them if they killed you? That’s just one more murder.” He had no reason to fantasize about the major leagues. For one, Fernandez knew nothing about MLB. “I heard that the best baseball was there,” he says, “but it’s not like I knew who the players were or who the teams were or anything.” Second, he had no reason to think he’d ever leave Cuba. If you want to escape, then you make a few calls, maybe hold a few meetings, pay somewhere between $500 and $10,000 (Fernandez says his defection cost about a grand), and the next thing you know, you’re on your way to a boat. But that’s the easy part. Most would-be defectors get caught, and generally, those are the lucky ones. Many Cubans refer to the stretch of water between Havana and Miami as the Caribbean’s largest cemetery. If the current doesn’t get you, then there’s always the threat of a leaky boat, a soldier’s bullet, or, in some cases, an aggressive shark.</p>

        <h1> Rise Through the Majors build </h1>
        <p>Fernandez's 2012 season was a stunning success: he pitched 134 innings between Low-A Greensboro and High-A Jupiter, posting a 1.75 ERA with a 158/35 K/BB and a mere 89 hits allowed. His velocity kicked up a bit and his feel for pitching was beyond his years. He jumped directly to the major leagues in 2013, skipping Double-A and Triple-A. He thrived, going 12-6 in 28 starts for Miami with a 2.19 ERA and a 187/58 K/BB in 172 innings, allowing a mere 111 hits. He made the All-Star team, came in third in Cy Young Award balloting, and was named National League Rookie of the Year.Fernandez opened 2014 in fine form with a 2.44 ERA in eight starts and a 70/13 K/BB in 51 innings. However, in mid-May he was placed on the disabled list with elbow discomfort. An MRI revealed a torn ligament and he had Tommy John surgery. His recovery was successful and he came back strong in the second half of 2015, posting a 2.92 ERA in 11 starts with a 79/14 K/BB in 65 innings.His 2016 season was another huge success: 16-8 in 29 starts, 2.86 ERA, 253/35 K/BB in 182 innings. If anything he was a more dominant pitcher after Tommy John than before, with a notable rise in strikeout rate without any loss of control. He regained his pre-injury velocity but had fully refined his secondary pitches. He had been especially dominant in the weeks before his death, posting a 29/5 K/BB in his last 22 innings. All told, Fernandez made 76 major league starts, going 38-17 with a 2.58 ERA in 471 innings with a 589/140 K/BB. He will go down in baseball history as one of the great "what if" stories, a true ace cut down much too early.</p>

        <h1> Sudden Passing </h1>
        <p>Miami Marlins ace Jose Fernandez was killed in a boating accident in Florida early Sunday morning. Spokesman Lorenzo Veloz of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a news conference Sunday that Fernandez, 24, was one of three men killed in the accident. The Coast Guard arrived on the scene around 3 a.m. to find a 32-foot boat upside down on a jetty off Miami Beach. Two of the victims were found dead under the vessel. One was found dead in the water. None of the deceased was wearing a life vest. Fernandez died from trauma -- not drowning, Veloz said. “It does appear that speed was involved due to the impact and the severity of it,” Velos said. “It appears they were coming at full speed when they encountered the jetty. There was not much evidence on the vessel, everything was in the water, [but] there was no indication of alcohol or any type of illegal drugs.”</p>
