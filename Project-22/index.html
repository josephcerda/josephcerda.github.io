                <h1> Pure Domination </h1>
                <p>The Miami Marlins selected right-handed pitcher Jose Fernandez with the 14th overall pick of the MLB Draft. He signed for a $2 million bonus. His scouting report out of Tampa’s Alonso High School was that he was primarily a fastball-slider pitcher, with his fastball hitting 97-98 mph but sitting regularly around 93-95 mph while the slider had “late movement that is nasty at times.”All told, Fernandez made 76 major league starts, going 38-17 with a 2.58 ERA in 471 innings with a 589/140 K/BB. He will go down in baseball history as one of the great "what if" stories, a true ace cut down much too early.</p>

            <h1> Reason for Rebuild </h1>
            <p>The 2017 Miami Marlins were bursting with potential. They had three franchise outfielders in Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich, and Marcell Ozuna, one of the fastest players in baseball in Dee Gordon, as well as breakout catcher J.T. Realmuto. Now, after a series of offseason trades, Realmuto is the only one still in South Florida. Yelich, who was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers last month, said the death of ace Jose Fernandez in 2016 is what ultimately led to the recent tear-down, reports ESPN's Jerry Crasnick. "From talking to the guys there - the guys who got traded and some of the guys who are still there - the consensus from our clubhouse is that everything changed after the tragedy with Jose," Yelich said. "I think everybody figured our window to win was with him. You have a bona fide ace, a No. 1 starter, and you kind of have something there with that. It's nobody's fault what happened. It's a tragedy in every sense of the word. Nobody could have seen that coming.</p>

            <h1> Impact of José</h1>
            <p>Since we lost José, I have yet to feel that same feeling. That #JoséDay feeling. I’ve already said my peace on our pitching staff. We have a talented staff of pitchers, some with great upside and potential. But this season, when the starter takes the mound, I am usually at a loss for expectations. You just never know anymore. Is [insert picture here] going to go out and let up six runs by the fourth? Or is he going to go eight scoreless? Every game is a crapshoot. That wasn’t how it was when José Fernández was pitching.No one in their right mind would attempt to refute the conclusion that in his day, José Fernández was one of the most dominant pitchers in the game. All sabermetrically-inclined stats illustrate that there were little to no flaws in Fernández’s game. If you played on a team with a name on the jersey other than “Marlins,” and you were matched up against José on his name-day, you were going to have your work cut out for you.But again, there is something more than just being a good pitcher that made José appointment-viewing baseball. There was something beyond the numbers — something about José’s demeanor that made people feel certain that they were going leave Marlins Park with a smile on #JoséDay. He wasn’t going to come out and paint corners, try and work ahead, maybe force some soft contact, etc. When he took the mound, he had full intentions of coming out and dominating, pounding the zone with some spicy cheddar, and then buckling hitters at the knees with the curveball.
